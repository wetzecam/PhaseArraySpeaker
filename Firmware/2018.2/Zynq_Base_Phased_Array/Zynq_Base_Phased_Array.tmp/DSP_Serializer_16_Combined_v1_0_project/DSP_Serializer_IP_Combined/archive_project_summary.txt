Section (1) - PROJECT INFORMATION
---------------------------------
Name      = DSP_Serializer_IP_Combined
Directory = /home/cameron/PhaseArraySpeaker/Firmware/2018.2/DSP_Serializer_IP_Combined

WARNING: Please verify the compiled library directory path for the following property in the
         current project. The path may point to an invalid location after opening this project.
         This could happen if the project was unarchived in a location where this path is not
         accessible. To resolve this issue, please set this property with the desired path
         before launching simulation:-

Property = compxlib.xsim_compiled_library_dir
Path     =
