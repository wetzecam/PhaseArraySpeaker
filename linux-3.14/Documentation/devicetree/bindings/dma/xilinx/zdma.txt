Xilinx ZDMA engine, it does support memory to memory transfers,
memory to device and device to memory transfers. It also has flow
control and rate control support for slave/peripheral dma access.

Zynq ultrascale MP soc has two instances of general purpose DMA(ZDMA).
one is located in FPD(full power domain) and other is located in
LPD(low power domain).

ZDMA instance located in FPD is referred as GDMA and instance located
in LPD is referred as ADMA.

GDMA is configured with 8 DMA channels and AXI bus width is 128 byte.
ADMA is configured with 8 DMA channels and AXI bus width is 64 byte.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "xlnx,gdma-1.0" or "xlnx,adma-1.0"
- reg: Memory map for gdma/adma module access.
- interrupt-parent: Interrupt controller the interrupt is routed through
- interrupts: Should contain DMA channel interrupt.
- id: Channel Id

Optional properties:
- xlnx,include-sg: Indicates the controller to operate in simple or scatter
		   gather dma mode
- xlnx,ratectrl: Scheduling interval in terms of clock cycles for
		 source AXI transaction
- xlnx,overfetch: Tells whether the channel is allowed to over fetch the data
- xlnx,src-issue: Number of AXI outstanding transactions on source side
- xlnx,desc-axi-cohrnt: Tells whether the AXI transactions generated for the
			descriptor read are marked Non-coherent
- xlnx,src-axi-cohrnt: Tells whether the AXI transactions generated for the
			source descriptor payload are marked Non-coherent
- xlnx,dst-axi-cohrnt: Tells whether the AXI transactions generated for the
			dst descriptor payload are marked Non-coherent
- xlnx,desc-axi-qos: AXI QOS bits to be used for descriptor fetch
- xlnx,src-axi-qos: AXI QOS bits to be used for data read
- xlnx,dst-axi-qos: Axi QOS bits to be used for data write
- xlnx,desc-axi-cache: AXI cache bits to be used for descriptor fetch
- xlnx,desc-axi-cache: AXI cache bits to be used for data read
- xlnx,desc-axi-cache: AXI cache bits to be used for data write
- xlnx,src-burst-len: AXI length for data read. Support only power of 2 values
		      i.e 1,2,4,8 and 16.
- xlnx,dst-burst-len: AXI length for data write. Support only power of 2 values
		      i.e 1,2,4,8 and 16.
