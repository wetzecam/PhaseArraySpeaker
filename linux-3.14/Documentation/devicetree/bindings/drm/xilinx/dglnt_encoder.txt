Device-Tree bindings for Digilent DRM Encoder Slave

This driver provides support for VGA and HDMI outputs on Digilent FPGA boards. The
VGA or HDMI port must be connected to a Xilinx display pipeline via an axi2vid
IP core.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "dglnt,drm-encoder".

Optional properties:
 - dglnt,edid-i2c: The I2C device connected to the DDC bus on the video connector.
                   This is used to obtain the supported resolutions of an attached 
                   monitor. If not defined, then a default set of resolutions is used
                   and the display will initialize to 720p. Note most VGA connectors
                   on Digilent boards do not have the DDC bus routed out. 

Example:

      encoder_0: digilent_encoder {
		   compatible = "dglnt,drm-encoder";
         dglnt,edid-i2c = <&i2c1>;
      };
